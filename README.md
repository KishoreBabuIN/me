# Me

ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Ritesh Gupta** from New Delhi, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

**iOS Developer** who wishes to compose everything with [protocols](https://speakerdeck.com/riteshhh/thinking-in-swift). I write/encourage/talk about protocol oriented programming a lot and almost to everyone (even if they ask me not too). 

In weekdays I power [Fueled](https://fueled.com) iOS apps. I have been working with swift for almost 2 years now and have made over 10 apps completely in swift. 

Other than coding you can find me [tweeting](https://twitter.com/_riteshhh) about iOS/swift/protocols/swift-evolution or my exploration with Indian fusion cuisines on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/riteshguptaa/)! Checkout the new season of [Samurai Jack](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/samurai-jack/) now & thank me later!

I have learned a lot from the Swift community via blogs, conferences, videos etc  and thus I also like to give back to the community as well via:

- [medium](https://medium.com/@_riteshhh) - this is where I share my swifty thoughts
- [swift-snippets](https://medium.com/swift-snippets) - its a medium publication managed by me where I post really cool snippets around extensions, protocols, generics etc
- [open-source](https://github.com/riteshhgupta?tab=repositories) - I enjoy coding & abstracting resuable components in iOS/Swift and convert them into pods for easy integration. One of my popular libraries is `TagCellLayout` which has over 20K downloads & powering around 150+ apps on appstore.
- [swift-meetups](https://swiftindia.github.io/swiftindia/) - I'm one of leading organisers of Swift India & lead its [Delhi chapter](https://www.meetup.com/Swift-Delhi/).

I'm a passionate Swift developer who thrives to learn something new everyday and believe in education as well within the community!
